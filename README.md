!Principal Component Analysis (PCA) README
##Tổng thể
This repository contains the implementation and documentation for Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique commonly used in various fields, including data analysis, image processing, and machine learning. This README provides information on how PCA is implemented, its applications, and how to use the provided code.
---------------------------------------------

##Introduction
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a mathematical technique that transforms high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional representation while retaining as much of the original variability as possible. It does this by identifying the principal components, which are the directions in the data with the maximum variance.
---------------------------------------------

##Usage
This repository provides a Python implementation of PCA. To use it in your project, follow the steps outlined in the Installation section. The main PCA functionality is encapsulated in the pca.py module, and usage examples are provided in the Usage Examples section.
---------------------------------------------

##Implementation Details
The PCA algorithm implemented in this repository follows these key steps:
1.	Data Preprocessing:
** Standardization of data (optional).
** Computation of the covariance matrix.
2.	Eigenvalue Decomposition:
** Calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix.
3.	Selection of Principal Components:
** Sorting eigenvalues in descending order.
** Selection of the top-k eigenvectors as principal components.
4.	Projection:
** Transformation of the original data into the reduced-dimensional space.

---------------------------------------------
##Applications
PCA has a wide range of applications, including:
•	Dimensionality reduction in machine learning.
•	Image compression and denoising.
•	Feature extraction in signal processing.
•	Exploratory data analysis.
•	Facial recognition systems.
•	...
